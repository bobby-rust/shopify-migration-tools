        [x] For Local store / delivery route, do you want the google maps integration on the landing page? 
            Or just a section on the landing page that links to it?

        [ ] CSA Page - form copied from old site - Community Supported Agriculture Share Options

        [ ] Button on landing page for going straight to whole beef / whole pork / other options

        [ ] Beef and pork are only 2 bulk options

        [ ] Whole animals product pages should be a form with options which are all on old site

        [ ] Main priority is customer knows what they want - they just want to find it

        [ ] Analytics would be very nice

        [ ] Price sheet page ported as a form with same content

        [ ] Blog ported from woocommerce to shopify - dates are not important, 
          group blog posts by year in a collection
        
        [ ] Price sheet page high prominence on landing page

        [ ] Same buttons on hero from old site as a section with high prominence on landing page

        [ ] Pickup policy removed

        [ ] Shipping and return policy page less cramped

          upon placing an order
          
        [ ] Shop now on landing page beef chicken pork and "other" card

        [ ] Of course we will iterate on these things and adjustments will be made

        [ ] Cuts & Boxes, CSA, Customs/Bulk as Cards in a section on landing page under a "Best Sellers" or "Shop Favorites"?

        [ ] Looking to add a section or sections to landing page to address the easy to see links to goal

        [ ] Under Shop in the navbar, the 'Shop By' section does not link to anything

        [ ] Winter vs. summer put on shipping page
        [ ] Shipping information on landing page or card that links to more details about it

        [ ] This page is just centered text could use a redesign to make it easier for users to find what they're looking for quickly.
        [ ] Will need lots of detail here -- this is too vague to assume

    Price sheet page - Most visited
        [ ] The new site does not have this page yet?
        [ ] Do you have any ideas on how you would like this page to look?

Website finished and switched over Christmas/New Year break?
[ ] 2 week break with no orders would be a great time to switch website

[ ] Clarify pay schedule - weekly, biweekly, by milestone

[ ] How to track hours? 
    - Weekly updates with tasks completed and hours spent on tasks - as a spreadsheet?

[ ] customers do not like change, maintain consistency with old site is preferred

[ ] Preferred method of communication and frequency for updates
    [ ] email, text, call, daily, weekly, by milestone, whenever i make noticeable progress

[ ] For accounts an order history would be great for customers to see what they ordered because they do not remember

[ ] Referral rewards for both referrer and referee

[ ] Points system earned points on every purchase is a good idea

[ ] Fun ideas for future - do you have any? Here are some ideas that i had:
